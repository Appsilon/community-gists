# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)

  # Set other options as needed.

# Install packages {{future}}, {{future.callr}}, and {{future.batchtools}} to allow use_targets() to configure tar_make_future() options.

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:

# Replace the target list below with your own:
